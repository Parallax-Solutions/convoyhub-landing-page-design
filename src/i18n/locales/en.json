      },
      "location": {
        "question": "Who can see my location?",
        "answer": "By default, only the ride organizer. You can disable location sharing at any time."

      "multipleMotos": {
        "question": "Can I have multiple bikes?",
        "answer": "Yes. Add as many as you want and select the active one for each ride. This helps validate compatibility."
      },
      "publicPrivate": {
        "question": "Are there public and private rides?",
        "answer": "Yes. Rides can be public (anyone can see), guild-only (members only), or by direct invitation."
      },
      "guilds": {
        "question": "How do guilds work?",

      "noSignal": {
        "question": "What happens if I lose signal?",
        "answer": "The organizer will see you're 'offline'. When you regain signal, your location updates automatically."

      "paidRides": {
        "question": "When will paid rides be available?",
        "answer": "Coming soon. We're preparing rides with registration for organized tours and professional guides."

      "addFriends": {
        "question": "How do I add friends in ConvoyHub?",
        "answer": "You can send friend requests from any rider's profile, or accept incoming ones. You can also add friends after sharing a ride — that's how you build a real trust network."
      },
      "friendsLocation": {
        "question": "Can my friends see my location?",
        "answer": "Not by default. The live map is only visible to the organizer. If we ever enable visibility between friends, it will be 100% opt-in and only during active rides."
